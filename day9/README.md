### Day 9

This was a nice problem that makes you remember the old days. Normally I thought simply using a map and iterating in a two pointer style without expanding the string would work, but I could not make it work. Thus I expaneded the string and iterated from there, with part 2 being O(N * M) complexity.

Will visit back in case i find time, this was a nice problem.
