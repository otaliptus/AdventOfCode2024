### Day 6

Cool problem.

First part is a simple DFS, nothing fancy.

Second one is really interesting. I thought hard on not to brute force from every square, and there are actually was for that - you can only try squares along the path essentially. But somehow I could not get the code to work, it was always finding more and doing stupid stuff, so I just gave up and brute forced my way through. Will visit this problem later at the end for sure, I don't want to lag behind :)
