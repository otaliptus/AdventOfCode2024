### Day 11

Having brute force working easily is a great fake in part 1. Luckily it did not take that long. As moves are independent, you can just take them one by one, and also store the number of moves that happens after them so that you don't need to reconstruct a tree whenever you encounter an already done number|remaining moves pair.

Nice problem.
