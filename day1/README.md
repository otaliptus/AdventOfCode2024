### Day 1

##### Part 1
A simple start, two lists of numbers given. Upon sorting, sum of differences per corresponding elements is asked.
Used some stupid trick to not to use if's while reading from file.

##### Part 2
Weighted sum of elements on the first list based on their frequency on the second list. Nothing fancy, just another map to store frequencies.
